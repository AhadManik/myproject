public class encapsulation {

	
	//deffination- bunding of data and method that operate on the data wthin a single unit[class]
	//hiding implementation details of a class from outside access
	
	//whatever access yoy want to give- that is upto the developer
	
	// how do we achive this in java
	//1.all the instance variables - declare them as private, so what happens is these private members can only be acccessed within the class.
	//2. to allow outside entities access to the intance varoables, oublic methods knows as getters and setters are defined. these
	//   are used to retrive and modify the value of the instance variables
	
	// whats is the consequence of creating setters and getters methods?
	
	//the class- it can enforce its own data validation rules
	
	//advantage :
	
	//1- Data hiding{increasing security]
	//2.flexibility
	//3.Accessibility
	//4.reuseablity
	//5. Testing code will became somewhat easire
